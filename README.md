F.A.Q.

What is BlockSwarm?
Blockswarm is the new face on online P2P filesharing! As demonstrated in recent years, torrenting websites are gaining in popularity in unforseen ways; but are still at the mercy of governments and corporations such and the Music and Film industry.

Centralised trackers such as The Pirate Bay and KickAss torrents hold the network together, but the entire system crumbles when one of these vital pieces of infastructure fails... this makes us sad :'(

So what does BlockSwarm do?
BlockSwarm is the brain-child of Cal Martin (With random bits of idea input from Cillian). It's inspired by the node based P2P network of FreeNet. BlockSwarm will be a new answer to sharing and downloading.

The network will be based on it's users, not a centralised tracker. The network will be almost impossible to collapse.

BlockSwarm will break up files into "Blocks" of a set size (eg. 100mb), and hash tables will maintain a database of what users have what blocks to make up a file. When a new user connects to the network for the first time, they will be connected to an other user and be given a copy of their has table. This will tell the new user all the files that the old user knows to exist. As users connect to eachother, their hash table will grow and so will the files availible to them as they are added to the network.

Files will be stored in the cache of every user, and complex algorithms will maintain files as long as they are in demand, and delete them if demand falls for a reasonable amount of time.

The beauty of blockswarm is that there is no central server to which all users must connect to, to find what files they can access. It's stored on every node, and as long as at least one other user is online, files can be downloaded.

When will BlockSwarm be ready for use?
As of writing this (March 18th 2016), BlockSwarm is very much in its infancy stages. There is currently no time frame assigned to the projects completion, but we promise we are passionate about this project and somethign will be made of it!
